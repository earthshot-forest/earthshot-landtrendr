# earthshot-landtrendr
Python implementation of LandTrendr algorithm to detect forest change.

The script in this repo was written as a Jupyter notebook almost entirely by Connor Richards (@crich011).

There is a lot of room for imporvement. Some ToDos:
1. Turn into a command line tool, so imputs can be passed into script instead of changeing the code.
2. Split apart the pre-processing and post-processing 
3. Validate the results agains the results from the GEE API.

LandTrendr [was developed and is maintained](https://emapr.github.io/LT-GEE/introduction.html) at Oregon State University.
It is also availble via the [Google Earth Engine API](https://geotrendr.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/landtrendr/).
